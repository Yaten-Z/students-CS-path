# 0. Before You Start

As a junior high school student, I've found that computer science is much more approachable than most people think, as long as you're genuinely interested and willing to learn. You don't have to be a genius, just be curious, consistent and hardworking.

## Before You Start

Before you begin, you might have a few questions:

1. **Do I need a powerful computer?**
***No.** An ordinary computer is more than enough when you're starting out.*
2. **Should I learn math first?**
***No.** Math determines your ceiling, not your floor.*
3. **Is English important?**
***Yes.** Many high-quality learning resources are available only in English.*
4. **Do I need to understand how computers work beforehand?**
***No.** You'll develop that understanding naturally as you learn.*
5. **Do I need to study computer science all day?**
***No.** In fact, many great developers maintain hobbies such as sports, reading, traveling, ~~and cross-dressing~~.*

Now, let's begin your journey into computer science.

At this point, you need not to build complex projects. understanding computer is more useful fou you. When you coding, you should feel the computer. First, you need to choose a first language.

## 1. First Programming Language

As a beginner, you don't need to master multiple languages right away. Mastering one core language is far more important for building a solid foundation.

### Python

Python is a language which is easy th get started. From AI to game dev, it does all. Also, it is readable and simple, read like English. And it has many libraries (pre-written code) for you to use.

### C++

C++ is the only language allowed in Olympiad in Information (OI, like NOI or USACO). It is also one of the fastest language, used for game engines and high-end software. And it can help you understand how computers actually work.

### Scratch

Scratch is the easiest entry point for younger learners or absolute beginners. Instead of typing lines of code, you snap together blocks like LEGOs. However, don't stay in the Scratch for too long; transition to text-based coding when you feel ready.

## 2. Core Skills for Students

### Linux

learn to use linux is a important milestone in a programmer's journey. Most of the world's servers, supercomputers, and Android phones run on Linux. Also, use Linux to program is much more essentially than use Windows. (in fact, macOS is a good choice too, but Mac is too expensive for most students.)

You don't need to delete Windows or macOS. You can try Linux inside a VM (Virtual Machine) or use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). you can just focus on basic trinal commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `grep` and etc.

### Git & GitHub

GitHub is the most important community for programmers. It's not just a place to store code, it's where you learn from others.

### Markdown

### Searching

### Math

### English

Google and AI
