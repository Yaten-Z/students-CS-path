# 0. Before You Start

As a junior high school student, I've found that computer science is much more approachable than most people think, as long as you're genuinely interested and willing to learn. You don't have to be a genius, just be curious, consistent and hardworking.

# Before You Start

Before you begin, you might have a few questions:

1. **Do I need a powerful computer?**
***No.** An ordinary computer is more than enough when you're starting out.*
2. **Should I learn math first?**
***No.** Math determines your ceiling, not your floor.*
3. **Is English important?**
***Yes.** Many high-quality learning resources are available only in English.*
4. **Do I need to understand how computers work beforehand?**
***No.** You'll develop that understanding naturally as you learn.*
5. **Do I need to study computer science all day?**
***No.** In fact, many great developers maintain hobbies such as sports, reading, traveling, ~~and cross-dressing~~.*

Now, let's begin your journey into computer science.

At this point, you need not to build complex projects. understanding computer is more useful fou you. When you coding, you should feel the computer. First, you need to choose a first language.

# 1. First Programming Language

As a beginner, you don't need to master multiple languages right away. Mastering one core language is far more important for building a solid foundation.

### Python

Python is a language which is easy th get started. From AI to game dev, it does all. Also, it is readable and simple, read like English. And it has many libraries (pre-written code) for you to use.

### C++

C++ is the only language allowed in Olympiad in Information (OI, like NOI or USACO). It is also one of the fastest language, used for game engines and high-end software. And it can help you understand how computers actually work.

### Scratch

Scratch is the easiest entry point for younger learners or absolute beginners. Instead of typing lines of code, you snap together blocks like LEGOs. However, don't stay in the Scratch for too long; transition to text-based coding when you feel ready.

# 2. Core Skills for Students

### Linux

learn to use linux is a important milestone in a programmer's journey. Most of the world's servers, supercomputers, and Android phones run on Linux. Also, use Linux to program is much more essentially than use Windows. (in fact, macOS is a good choice too, but Mac is too expensive for most students.)

You don't need to delete Windows or macOS. You can try Linux inside a VM (Virtual Machine) or use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). you can just focus on basic trinal commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `grep` and etc.

### Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a platform that hosts your Git repositories and allows you to share your code with the world. Learning Git and GitHub will enable you to manage your projects more effectively and collaborate with other developers. You can start by learning basic commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. As you become more comfortable, you can explore more advanced features like branching and pull requests.

### Markdown
Markdown is a simple way to format text. It's used everywhere, from GitHub to blogs. Learning Markdown will help you write better documentation and communicate more effectively with other developers. You can learn Markdown in just a few minutes, and it's a skill that will serve you well throughout your programming journey.

### Searching
Knowing how to search effectively is a crucial skill for any programmer. When you encounter a problem, the first step is to search for it online. Use specific keywords related to your issue, and don't be afraid to read through forums, documentation, and tutorials. The ability to find solutions quickly will save you a lot of time and frustration. Using AI tools like Deepseek or ChatGPT can also be a great way to get quick answers and explanations, but make sure to verify the information you receive from AI with other sources.

### Math
While you don't need to be a math genius to start programming, having a good grasp of basic math concepts can be very helpful. Topics like algebra, logic, and discrete mathematics often come up in programming. As you progress, you may find that certain areas of computer science, such as algorithms and data structures, require more advanced math. However, you can learn these concepts as you go along, so don't worry about mastering them before you start coding. 

### English
English is the lingua franca of programming. Most programming languages use English keywords, and the majority of documentation, tutorials, and forums are in English. While you can start learning to code without being fluent in English, improving your English skills will open up a world of resources and opportunities in the programming community. You can start by learning basic technical vocabulary and gradually improve your reading and writing skills as you go.

### Google and AI
Being able to effectively use search engines and AI tools is an essential skill for programmers. When you encounter a problem or need to learn something new, the first step is often to search for it online. Use specific keywords related to your issue, and don't be afraid to read through forums, documentation, and tutorials. AI tools like Deepseek or ChatGPT can also be great resources for getting quick answers and explanations. However, it's important to verify the information you receive from AI with other sources, as AI can sometimes provide inaccurate or incomplete information.
